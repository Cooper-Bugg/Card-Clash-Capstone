GAME REVIEW DOCUMENT - BLOOKET (3 LIVE GROUP MODES ONLY)
================================================================================

GAME NAME: Blooket
MODES REVIEWED: Gold Quest, Crypto Hack, Deceptive Dinos
DATE REVIEWED: January 25, 2026
SCOPE: Live group competitive modes only

================================================================================
1. CORE MECHANIC
================================================================================

All three modes share a common formula:
1. Answer multiple choice questions correctly to earn opportunities
2. Choose from hidden options revealing rewards/consequences  
3. Compete against other players to accumulate the most currency
4. Self-paced questioning (students answer on own devices at own speed)
5. Competitive, luck-based races with strategic elements

**GOLD QUEST:**
- Answer questions → pick 1 of 3 mystery chests → collect gold
- Chests contain: fixed gold (10, 25, 40, 100), multipliers (2x, 3x), steal mechanics (take % from others), swap mechanics (trade totals with another player), or penalties (lose 25% or 50% of gold)
- Winner has most gold when time/goal is reached
- Pure luck-based according to developers
- Extremely chaotic and fast-paced
- Special Blook bonuses: Wizard (take 25%), Elf (take 10%), Fairy (nothing), Slime Monster (lose 25%), Jester (double), Dragon (lose 50%), Unicorn (triple), King (swap)

**CRYPTO HACK:**
- At game start, choose password from 5 options
- Answer questions → pick 1 of 3 hidden options OR choose "hack" option
- Hidden options give crypto amounts
- "Hack" option: select player + guess their password to steal ALL their crypto
- Includes Among Us-style task completions (slow you down but grant rewards)
- Memory element: track password options and failed hack attempts
- No percentage loss or swap mechanics (cleaner than Gold Quest)
- Winner has most crypto at end

**DECEPTIVE DINOS:**
- Answer questions → choose "excavate" or "investigate"
- Excavate: pick 1 of 3 rocks (contain fossils/multipliers) OR click "cheat" button to peek at all 3 rocks before choosing
- Investigate: view player list, select someone to scan - if they cheated recently, catch them and they lose large % of fossils
- Risk/reward: cheating reveals best options but risks getting caught
- Social deduction element: who's cheating?
- Fossil multipliers stack infinitely
- No double/triple bonuses or percentage steals (unlike Gold Quest/Crypto)
- Winner has most fossils at end

Win conditions:
- All modes: Time-based (most currency when timer ends) OR goal-based (first to reach X amount)
- Teacher sets these parameters before game starts


================================================================================
2. SUB MECHANICS
================================================================================

**Question Format:**
- Multiple choice ONLY across all three modes (major limitation)
- Self-paced prompting with high frequency questioning
- Students answer on individual devices
- No synced questioning (unlike Kahoot)
- Incorrect answers = no reward, move to next question

**Gold Quest Specific Mechanics:**
- Mystery chest system with 8 different outcomes
- Steal mechanics: target specific players to take their gold
- Swap mechanics: trade entire totals with another player (can backfire)
- Percentage loss penalties: -25% or -50% from bad chests
- Multiplier chests: 2x or 3x current gold
- Fixed gold chests: 10, 25, 40, or 100 gold
- Special Blook passive abilities enhance chest outcomes
- No strategy according to developers ("purposefully all luck-based")

**Crypto Hack Specific Mechanics:**
- Password selection creates asymmetric information
- 5 password options at start (players choose privately)
- Hack mechanic: 
  * Select target player
  * Guess their password from 5 options
  * Correct guess = steal ALL their crypto
  * Wrong guess = see correct answer for next attempt
- Task completion system (Among Us reference):
  * Complete mini-tasks for bonus crypto
  * Tasks slow down question answering
  * Examples: wire connecting, card swiping, sample scanning
- Memory game: remembering password options and tracking attempts
- No direct loss mechanics (only lose if hacked)
- Strategic targeting: who has most crypto? Who picked obvious password?

**Deceptive Dinos Specific Mechanics:**
- Dual-choice system: excavate vs investigate
- Excavate options:
  * Pick rock blindly (contains fossil amount or multiplier)
  * Use "cheat" button to reveal all 3 rocks' contents first
  * Cheating allows informed choice but creates risk
- Investigation mechanics:
  * View full player list
  * Select one player to scan
  * If they cheated recently, catch them
  * Caught players lose large % of fossils (punishment varies)
- Risk assessment: when to cheat vs play safe?
- Social reads: who's accumulating too fast (likely cheating)?
- Multiplier stacking creates exponential growth potential
- No "nothing" outcomes (every rock has value)
- Detective board interface for tracking investigations

**Shared Across All Modes:**
- Self-paced timing allows catch-up opportunities
- High question frequency (ideal: 7-8 min games)
- Individual competition (no team variants for these 3 modes)
- Real-time leaderboard visible to all players
- Celebration animations for big wins/steals/catches

================================================================================
13. ISSUES
================================================================================

PAIN POINTS (from reviews and user feedback):

Top 3 teacher complaints:
1. Limited to multiple choice questions only - no open-ended, matching, sequencing, etc.
2. Enhanced reports locked behind paywall - free reports too basic for data-driven instruction
3. Game mechanics can overshadow learning - students focus on winning rather than accuracy

Top 3 student complaints:
1. Luck factor in Gold Quest frustrates students who study hard but lose to lucky guesses
2. Fast pace can be stressful despite self-paced questioning
3. Requires many questions to avoid repetition in longer sessions

Missing features users want:
- Question format variety (true/false, open-ended, matching)
- Mid-game teacher controls (pause, skip question)
- Better free-tier reporting
- Reading support for struggling readers
- Team variants of these modes

Bugs/issues noticed during testing:
- Occasional disconnections in live games
- Lag with very large groups (200+ players)
- Rare leaderboard display glitches

SPECIFIC ISSUES FOR THESE 3 MODES:

**Gold Quest:**
- Too luck-based: skilled students frustrated by RNG (random number generation)
- Swap mechanic can feel punishing (lose all progress randomly)
- Steal mechanics can create negative social dynamics
- No actual strategy (developer admits it's "purposefully all luck")
- Students may focus entirely on chest choice rather than question accuracy

**Crypto Hack:**
- Password guessing can feel tedious if memory is poor
- Hacking success relies heavily on luck (guessing)
- Task completion mechanic slows down pace (some students skip tasks)
- More complex ruleset may confuse younger students
- Memory element disadvantages students with working memory challenges

**Deceptive Dinos:**
- Cheat mechanic teaches "cheating is rewarded" (needs careful framing)
- Social deduction difficult for younger students (3rd-4th grade may struggle)
- Investigation feels like "policing" other students
- Risk/reward calculation may be too complex for some
- Students who never cheat fall behind those who cheat successfully

Our opportunity to differentiate:
1. Multiple question formats (not just multiple choice)
2. Reduce luck dependency - reward accuracy more directly
3. Collaborative modes that de-emphasize individual competition
4. Better scaffolding for mixed-ability groups
5. Stronger free-tier reporting tools
6. Built-in reading support (text-to-speech, adjustable text)
7. Mid-game teacher controls (pause, adjust difficulty)
8. Transparent skill-based progression (less RNG)

Additional notes:
- These 3 modes praised for engagement but criticized for luck > skill
- Teachers report using them primarily for review, not assessment
- Work best for reinforcement and motivation, not initial instruction
- Students love them but learning outcomes can be shallow


================================================================================
SYNTHESIS & ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FEATURES WE SHOULD STEAL:

1. **Self-paced question answering within live games**
   - Reduces pressure and anxiety
   - Allows differentiation naturally
   - Students answer on own devices at own speed
   - Maintains competitive element without forced synchronization

2. **Mystery reward system** (Gold Quest chest concept)

================================================================================
OVERALL IMPRESSION
================================================================================

First impression (1 paragraph summary):
These three Blooket modes represent different approaches to gamifying quiz review: Gold Quest emphasizes pure luck and chaos, Crypto Hack adds memory and strategic targeting, and Deceptive Dinos introduces social deduction and risk management. All three successfully engage students through self-paced competition and compelling reward systems, but their heavy reliance on luck over skill creates frustration for effort-oriented learners. The multiple choice-only format and minimal free reporting limit pedagogical value, though the low barrier to entry and generous free tier make them accessible starting points for gamification in education.

Strengths:
- **Extremely engaging** - students consistently request these modes
- **Low barrier to entry** - no accounts required, simple game codes
- **Self-paced questioning** - reduces pressure vs Kahoot
- **Visual appeal** - distinct themes for each mode
- **Free tier includes everything** - all 3 modes playable with 60 students
- **Fast setup** - teacher can launch game in 2-3 minutes
- **Variety** - 3 distinct experiences from same question set

Weaknesses:
- **Luck > Skill** - Gold Quest especially rewards random chance over learning
- **Multiple choice only** - limits assessment depth
- **Free reporting too basic** - teachers need more data
- **Social dynamics** - steal/swap/hack mechanics can create negativity
- **No mid-game controls** - teacher can't pause or adjust
- **Accessibility gaps** - no reading support, minimal color-blind accommodation
- **Shallow learning** - focus on winning over mastery

Best feature overall for these 3 modes:
- **Self-paced question answering within competitive live game** creates perfect balance: students feel competitive pressure (leaderboard, time limit) but answer at own speed (reduces anxiety, allows differentiation)

Biggest missed opportunity for these 3 modes:
- **Replacing luck with skill-based progression** - Gold Quest's pure RNG frustrates students who study hard; could redesign to reward accuracy, speed, and strategic thinking while maintaining excitement

Relevance to our project:

**ADOPT:**
- Self-paced questioning within live competitive environment
- Mystery reward reveals (visual satisfaction)
- Distinct thematic presentation
- Simple joining process (code-based)
- Real-time leaderboards

**AVOID:**
- Pure luck mechanics (Gold Quest's RNG)
- Multiple choice only limitation
- Paywall for basic reporting
- Social mechanics that feel punishing (steal/swap)
- "Cheating" as game mechanic

**DIFFERENTIATE:**
- Question format variety (beyond multiple choice)
- Skill-based progression (accuracy matters more than luck)
- Collaborative team modes
- Adaptive difficulty
- Built-in reading support
- Stronger free-tier teacher tools
- Mid-game teacher controls

**KEY INSIGHT:**
Blooket proves themed game modes dramatically increase engagement over bare quiz formats, but success requires balancing fun with learning. Our opportunity: create equally engaging modes that transparently connect effort → mastery → game success, avoiding the "lucky guess beats hard work" problem that frustrates both students and teachers.

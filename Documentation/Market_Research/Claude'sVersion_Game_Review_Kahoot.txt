================================================================================
13. ISSUES
================================================================================

PAIN POINTS (from reviews and user feedback):

Top 3 teacher complaints:
1. Confusing pricing structure with features fragmented across tiers.
2. Free plan very limited (10-player cap frustrating for typical classrooms).
3. No monthly billing for education plans (annual payment required).

Top 3 student complaints:
1. Occasional lag/glitches during gameplay disrupting experience.
2. Timer pressure too stressful for some learners.
3. Limited free features (avatars, themes locked behind paywall).

Missing features users want:
- Adjustable team talk duration (currently fixed 5 seconds).
- Question randomization/subset selection from larger question banks.
- Monthly billing option for education.

Bugs/issues noticed during testing:
- Not directly tested; user reviews mention connectivity issues with poor internet, payment system glitches.

Our opportunity to differentiate:
- Simpler pricing structure, larger free tier participant limit, built-in differentiation for mixed-ability groups.

Additional notes:
- Reviews praise engagement but criticize depth ("shallow assessment," best for quick drills not deep learning).


================================================================================
SYNTHESIS & ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FEATURES WE SHOULD STEAL:
1. Challenge mode (self-paced asynchronous gameplay with deadline).
2. Color-coded answer shapes (accessibility + visual clarity).
3. Real-time scoreboard creating competitive energy.
4. Team mode with discussion time between questions.
5. Public question library (millions of ready-to-use questions).

FEATURES WE SHOULD AVOID:
1. Complex multi-tier pricing confusing users.
2. Strict 10-player cap on free tier (too limiting).
3. Speed-only scoring disadvantaging thoughtful learners.

UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATOR IDEAS:
(What could we do that they don't?)
1. Include adaptivity - adjust question difficulty based on student performance.
2. Monthly billing for all tiers (not just annual).
3. Built-in collaborative features beyond just team competition.

ENGAGEMENT HOOKS OBSERVED:
What makes students want to play again?
- Live leaderboard competition, podium celebration, playful visuals, immediate feedback.

Rewards/incentive systems:
- Points, leaderboard placement, podium top 3, avatar unlocks (premium).

Leaderboards (class-wide, global, friends-only?):
- Class-wide in live games, tournament leaderboards can combine multiple sessions.

Progress visualization:
- Score accumulation during game, progress bars in self-study modes.

SOCIAL/MULTIPLAYER STRUCTURE:
How do students join games? (code system, links, etc.):
- PIN code entry at kahoot.it or direct link sharing; automatic team assignment in team mode.

Live multiplayer vs asynchronous?
- Both: Live mode (synchronous, teacher-paced), Challenge mode (asynchronous, self-paced).

Team modes?
- Yes: Shared device (1 device per team) and Individual devices (each player has device, assigned to teams).

Chat/communication features?
- None; team talk provides timed discussion periods in team mode only.


================================================================================
OVERALL IMPRESSION
================================================================================

First impression (1 paragraph summary):
Kahoot is the industry standard for game-based learning with proven engagement through its energetic quiz format, vibrant visuals, and competitive leaderboard system. The platform excels at creating excitement around content review and quick knowledge checks, with strong accessibility features and massive content library. However, restrictive free tier limits, confusing pricing tiers, and emphasis on speed over deep understanding create barriers for some users.

Strengths:
- Massive established user base and content library.
- Extremely engaging for students (fun, competitive, fast-paced).
- Strong accessibility (shapes+colors, screen reader support, multiple languages).
- Flexible modes (live, self-paced, team).
- Easy to use for both teachers and students.

Weaknesses:
- 10-player free limit too small for typical classrooms.
- Pricing structure confusing, features fragmented across tiers.
- Shallow assessment (best for recall, not deep understanding).
- Speed emphasis can disadvantage thoughtful learners.
- Annual-only billing for education plans.

Best feature overall:
- Challenge mode enabling self-paced asynchronous learning with deadline flexibility.

Biggest missed opportunity:
- No adaptive difficulty or personalized learning paths; all students get identical questions regardless of mastery level.

Relevance to our project (how does this inform our design?):
Kahoot proves game-based trivia works for elementary students. We should adopt Challenge-mode flexibility, color-coded accessibility, and team collaboration features while avoiding complex pricing and speed-only scoring. Opportunity to differentiate through adaptive difficulty, simpler free tier, and deeper assessment beyond rapid recall.
